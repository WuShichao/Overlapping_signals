# Overlapping_signals
Repository containing all the codes raltive to overlapping signals.

The notebooks that are contained here look at the behaviour of a signal that is injected and the possibility to retrieve the event that is basically present as function of the amplitude of the injected signal. Once we understand the behaviour, we can look at the possibility to detect an event as function of the time gap between the two mergers.

black_holes_overlap --> Contains the study of the behaviour of the injcted signals
stat_SNR_fct_amp --> see the possibility to detect the correct event as function of the amplitude ratio
overlap_5s_GW150914 and overlap_other_times_GW150914 --> contain the possibility to detect the events as function of the time gap
overlap_002_GW150914 --> looks at the problematic behaviour of the black holes as they are too close to each other
overlap_NS_BH --> looks at the possibility to retireve the two events when a BH and a NS overlap
overlap_NS_NS --> loks at the possibility to retruve the two events when two BNS overlap
